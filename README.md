# Debate App
## Cse 442 Project: a web app for debates and other discussions

  This project is a response to Dr Hartloff's pitch for an app where debates and discussions can take place. Participants can create a debate based on a certain topic or statement. Then, participants can make and discuss points in favor or against the initial statement. We will create a webapp for this project, allowing use on mobile or desktop devices in different browsers. Once this app is live, it will have applications in classroom discussions, in workplace decision-making, and in the general public for discussion of widely debated topics.
