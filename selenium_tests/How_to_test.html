<h1>How To Run Our Automated Browser Tests</h1>
<p>
  Welsome to the automated browser testing section of the Debate App.
  This page is a basic overview of how to get started with our tests.
  Currently, we support Chrome and Firefox.
</p>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>
  To run any of these tests, you will need to have Selenium installed on your system.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Python needs to be installed: <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">Python downloads</a></li>
  <li>Make sure you have pip installed: <a href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/">Pip documentation</a></li>
  <li>Install Selenium using the command "pip install -U selenium" <a href="https://www.seleniumhq.org/download/">More download information here.</a></li>
  <li>Install the browser you are testing on your system: <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/">Chrome</a> <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/">Firefox</a></li>
  <li>
    Our test folders include the drivers for each browser, and these specific paths are referenced in the code.
    However, you can download your own drivers if necessary. <a href="https://seleniumhq.github.io/selenium/docs/api/py/index.html#drivers">More information here.</a>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  You should now be able to run Selenium tests in python. If you need more help, <a href="https://seleniumhq.github.io/selenium/docs/api/py/index.html">check out the official documentation</a>.
  Tests can be run from the console as ordinary python files.
